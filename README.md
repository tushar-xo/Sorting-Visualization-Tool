The Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to visually demonstrate various sorting algorithms. The tool provides users with a graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step on an array of numbers. It helps users understand and compare the efficiency and behavior of different sorting techniques.

# Features
Interactive Visualization: Watch sorting algorithms operate in real-time on an array of randomly generated numbers.
Adjust the size of the array to be sorted.
Control the speed of the visualization to slow down or speed up the sorting process.
Random Array Generation: Generate a new random array with customizable size at any time.
Pause/Resume and Reset: Pause the visualization, resume from where you left off, or reset the sorting process.

# Sorting Algorithms Explained:
Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, "bubbling" the largest unsorted element to the end.
Selection Sort: Finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements in their correct position.
Merge Sort: Divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the sorted halves.
Quick Sort: Picks a pivot, partitions the array, and recursively sorts the partitions.
Heap Sort: Builds a heap and repeatedly extracts the largest element to place it in its correct position.
